# Final_Django_tweet
I had created a very basic tweet website using HTML , CSS , Django which allows users to create ,edit , post and delete their tweets . This gives an brief idea of how authenticated users are allowed to sign and sign out on their own basis.  The users can create an account , post a tweet with an image attached to it , edit/ delete the post .
